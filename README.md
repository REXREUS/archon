**ArchonCLI** is an autonomous AI-powered code architect assistant designed to help developers master complex codebases through deep semantic analysis and a modern terminal interface.

## ✨ Why ArchonCLI?

Traditional code assistants often struggle with large-scale projects due to fragmented context. ArchonCLI solves this by combining **Semantic Syntax-Aware Indexing** with the reasoning power of **Google Gemini 3**.

### 🚀 Key Features

*   **🧠 Syntax-Aware RAG**: Uses **Tree-Sitter** to understand code structure (functions, classes, types) instead of just raw text.
*   **💻 Dual Interface**: Choose between a visually rich **Interactive TUI** (Bubble Tea) or a scriptable **CLI** (Cobra).
*   **⚡ Smart Optimization**: Leverage **Context Caching** to reduce latency and API costs by up to 90%.
*   **🛠️ Developer Power Tools**:
    *   `review`: Automated AI code review for staged changes.
    *   `commit`: Generate Conventional Commit messages from your diffs.
    *   `test`: Instant unit test generation for any file.
    *   `diagram`: Generate Mermaid/PlantUML diagrams of your architecture.
    *   `refactor`: Get AI-driven refactoring suggestions or apply them directly.

```
- **Windows (PowerShell)**: 
```bash 
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rexreus/archon/main/scripts/uninstall.ps1 | iex
```

**Manual Build:**
```bash
go build -o archon ./cmd/archon/main.go
```

### 2. Initialize & Authenticate
Run these commands in your project's root directory:

```bash
# Create config file
archon init

# Set your Gemini API Key
archon auth --key "YOUR_API_KEY"
```

### 3. Index & Ask
Index your codebase to enable semantic search, then start asking:

```bash
# Build the vector index
archon index

# Ask away!
archon ask "How is the data flow handled in this project?"
```

*Or just run `archon` to enter the **Interactive TUI Mode**.*
